<h1 id="one"><font color="red">Part 1:</font> INTRO — June 27</h1>
<br>
<h2><font color="blue">AT DRIVEDRIVE (TESTDRIVE), NICOSIA</font></h2>

<p>	The introductory event will take place in the center of Nicosia, at the TESTDRIVE at the newly opened art space DRIVEDRIVE. Here we will present a number of projects initiated by Honest Electronics collective.</p>	

<p>	🔹 Arrbutus plays "Helping Hand" live.<br>
🔹 Michalis Shammas presents "Kyklophonon II" Instument<br>
🔹 "Crossdressing Dioegenes" Zine Launch<br>
🔹 Nico Stephou presents "Clusters" Visual identity<br>
🔹 "Mutual Ground II" will be released, our second music compilation.<br>
🔹 & Aristos Ioannou is hosting the talk "Initiating Ideas"</p>


<p>🔹 The co-founder of DRIVEDRIVE and visual artist Sayia Navva will present her recent musical output which was released on the Honest Electronics label under the Arbutus moniker titled 'Helping Hands' E.P.</p>

<p>🔹Alongside Sayia will be Michalis Shammas, musician and music instrument inventor who will present the 'Kyklophonon II' an instrument engineered and built by himself. Michalis who performs under the name Michalis Sham will give a 30 minute 'demonstration' of the instrument and his upcoming EP.</p>

<p>🔹 'Crossdressing Diogenes', is a zine created to archive and promote the underground electronic music scene of the island. The magazine is an edit of Nick Herzberg's sociology thesis on the Cypriot scene edited by Peter Eramian and designed by Nico Stephou. It has the intention to be 'observational and responsive, not driven by a desire to fit Cyprus and its music scene into a narrative'.</p>

<p>🔹Clusters is the visual identity of the entire ' summer activities' project, created by Nico Stephou, visual artist and co-founder of Honest Electronics. Each artist of the upcoming festival has been associated with an 'artefact' that Nico has designed. The 'clusters' are the visual combination of these 'artefacts' into abstract compositions suggesting the power of a community.</p>

<p>🔹Mutual Ground Vol II is the second music compilation released by the Honest Electronics label. It acts as a preview of the music which will be heard at the events, with (number) performing artists contributing an original composition to the compilation. The compilation will be sold together with last years compilation on a special packaging.</p>

            <h3>Joralsky (CY)</h3>
	       	<p>Over the last couple of years Joralsky has been consistently delivering some memorable hyperlocal sets that take into deep consideration both the dancing community and its surrounding environment, which in turn render “genre” as trivial and antiquated. Hence, the diversity of parties he has cofounded: C’est demon! & Programmed for Love.
In response to this year’s Earthgaze theme, he is preparing a sunrise set that reflects on the possibility of different gazes. In his own words: “There are two ways one can gaze on earth’s soil…either directly on the ground or if the soil itself becomes dust in the atmosphere. While the first gaze suggests a contemplative, solitary gaze, the second one requires a group commotion agitating the earth: this one implies dancing. My set will oscillate between these two possible earthgazes.” <a href="https://honestelectronics.bandcamp.com/track/futures" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a></p>

           <img src="images/atf-26.png" width="100%" class="sideimg2">
            <h3>Jay Glass Dubs (GR)</h3>
	       	<p>Jay Glass Dubs is an exercise of style focusing on a counter-factual historical approach of dub music, stripped down to its basic drum/bass/vox/effects form.<br>

Dimitris Papadatos (b.1981,USA) is a composer, musician and sound artist based in Athens Greece.<br>

The main concern in his work is an apposition of disparate elements that assume a re-appropriation of historically applied methodologies while questioning forms of empowering them.The biggest body of his work reflects issues as copyright, spirituality and originality, undergoing a constant state of transfiguration of its outsourcing. He has performed in venues and spaces such as Portikus in Frankfurt, Klub Kegelbahn in Lucerne, Departamento in Mexico City, Corsica Studios and Rye Wax in London, Macao in Milan, Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, Bios in Athens, Soup Kitchen in Manchester, Salon Des Amateurs in Dusseldorf , among others while he has recorded broadcasts for stations such as NTS Radio, Rinse FM,  Radar Radio, dublab and Resonance FM.
His music is been featured in various radio shows including BBC Radio 3's Late Junction, NTS Radio,WFMU, Rinse FM & Rinse France, Resonance FM, Independent Music Podcast, Dublab and Tiny Mix Tapes' Tabs Out Podcast to name a few.<br>
Since 2017 he is resident selector for Noods Radio in Bristol, and LYL Radio in Lyon. <a href="https://iamku.net/" target="_blank">Official Website</a>

            <h3>Kris Vango (DE)</h3>
	       	<p>Explaining his approach to music as “an emotional purge and an exploration into the realms of the universal soul”, producer/visual artist Kris Vango brings together dark fragmented sounds of the techno underground with an ambient space of hope and utopia. Born and raised in Australia, the roots of Vango’s music echo the countries expansive and dramatic landscapes, mirrored against the dark hedonistic shadow-side of the underground club scene of Berlin, where he has been living for the past 4 years. It is Vango’s belief that our sense of existence is interpreted through systems created by our varying global cultures, religions and stories of the universe, he believes the keys to unlocking our human potential are in the overlapping patterns of ancient theories and systems - and reinterpreting them into our modern intellectual observations of the physical world of science and quantum physics. It is this relationship between the physical and non physical aspects of our conscious life on earth that he finds most interesting. His soundscapes reflect and explore these patterns, symbols and systems through the universal language of emotions; art and frequencies. It is the research of these explorations that are expressed through music, inviting the listener to discover aspects of themselves by using sound and music frequencies to interpret the stories of ancient systems and ideologies. <a href="<a href="https://soundcloud.com/krisvango" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a></p>

            <h3>Oswaldo III (CY)</h3>
	       	<p>Oswaldo III uses an all hardware setup for his live sets that get further elaborated on the spot, trailblazing through house and techno tropes. It was originally conceived with this Simondon quote in mind, which best capture his relationship to gear:
“That said, contemplation is not techno-aesthetics’ primary category. It’s in usage, in action, that it becomes something orgasmic, a tactile means and motor of stimulation. When a nut that is stuck becomes unstuck, one experiences a motoric pleasure, a certain instrumentalized joy, a communication–mediated by the tool–with the thing on which the tool is working. […] It’s a type of intuition that’s perceptive-motoric and sensorial. The body of the operator gives and receives. Even a machine like the lathe or the milling machine produces this particular sensation. There exists an entire sensorial array of tools of all kinds.” <a href="https://soundcloud.com/oswaldo-iii" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a></p>

            <h3>RAT (CY)</h3>
	       	<p>Hailing from the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, Andreas’ love for music and sound was expressed at a young age. He picked up the guitar and started numerous bands, growing strong as a performer in the local scene. Experimenting with guitar pedals and sound is what pushed him into pursuing a degree in Sound Engineering (BSc Hons). Being constantly exposed to synthesis, digital manipulation and psychoacoustics, pushed Andreas into exploring his identity as Rat and electronic music production. He found himself sonically in London during his post-graduate degree (MA) in Audio Production in 2012. Since then Rat has been constantly releasing music on various local and international labels with undertones of dub, techno and garage. Rat’s productions have a distinct complexity in both sound design and synthesis; a skill developed through his studies and professional work as a sound designer, as well as poly-rhythmic and convoluted rhythmic patterns; an influence and homage to his progressive rock roots. As Rat never picked up DJing, he decided to putt his technical know-how to good use, and started playing live sets using a variety of analogue synthesizers, his guitar and Ableton Live as a sequencer and workstation. His live sets are an emotional rollercoaster spanning from deep sentiment all the way to floor stomping rhythms. <a href="http://smarturl.it/rat.aphelionep" target="_blank">Album</a></p>

            <h3>Pfysics (CY)</h3>
	       	<p>"Pfysics" is duo Panayotis and Kalaqs. Their interest in transfusing guitars with electronics led them to explore a common sound which often veers into the vastness of empty spaces between silence and light, a dichotomy of non opposables.  Kalaqs was born in Limassol. He got involved in music and visual arts from a young age and in 2015 he graduated from the Athens School of Fine Arts. He has been experimenting with guitars and pedals since his teens and often found himself in bands, collaborations and solo performances.   <br>

Panayotis is an audiovisual anti-auteur. His debut album 'Hawaiiprus' is a socio-psychological study of the place he lives (Cyprus) in the quise of a novel where the protagonist is a mysterious island. 
He performs using a selection of electronic modular sythesizers, drum machines and haptic instruments, guitars, drums and microphones which metamorphose constantly as his sets are often based on autoschediasm. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/honest-electronics/hmix16-panayotis-locusto-mornings" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a></p></p>
